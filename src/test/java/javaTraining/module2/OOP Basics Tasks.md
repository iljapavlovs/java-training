### Create an Animal class. Animal class should have
1. 3 fields - age, size, color (don`t use public access level, nor default) - **Access Level, Instance Variables**
2. Provide interfaces for writing and reading Animal`s class fields. Name of the parameters should be the same as the fields (**Methods, Encapsulation, Getters/Setters**)
3. 3 behaviours - eating, sleeping, making a noise. All 3 should just output corresponding behaviour to console.(**Methods**)
4. Create another behaviour with the same behaviour name as when making a noise, but this time you should set what the output should be. (**Overloading, Method Parameters**)
5. 2 ways of constructing the Animal class - by setting only the age and setting all 3 fields at once. (**Constructors**)
6. Create 2 animal objects constructing those with different constructors. This should be done from a separate file. (**Main Method**)
7. Set all missing fields for the objects
8. Invoke all behaviours
